/*   Programming considerations of the dialog Boxes    */

1. Dialog Box Procedures : A dialog box procedure is similar to a window procedure in that the system sends messages to the procedure when   
                           it has information to give or tasks to carry out.
                           
  NOTE : Unlike a window procedure, a dialog box procedure never calls the DefWindowProc function. Instead, 
  it returns TRUE if it processes a message or FALSE if it does not.
  
   /*--------------------- Dialog procedure will be of the following  form: ------------------------------*/    
    BOOL CALLBACK DlgProc(HWND hwndDlg, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) 
{ 
    switch (message) 
    { 
 
        // Place message cases here. 
 
        default: 
            return FALSE; 
    } 
}

        The procedure parameters serve the same purpose as in a window procedure, with the hwndDlg parameter receiving the window handle
of the dialog box.

Most dialog box procedures process the WM_INITDIALOG message and the WM_COMMAND messages sent by the controls, but process few if 
any other messages.

WM_INITDIALOG --- Sent to the dialog box procedure immediately before a dialog box is displayed. Dialog box procedures typically 
use this message to initialize controls and carry out any other initialization tasks that affect the appearance of the dialog box.

If a dialog box procedure does not process a message, it must return FALSE to direct the system to process the messages internally.

---------------------------------- The WM_INITDIALOG Message -------------------------------
The system does not send a WM_CREATE message to the dialog box procedure. Instead, it sends a WM_INITDIALOG message when
it creates the dialog box and all its controls but before it displays the dialog box.

The procedure should carry out any initialization required to ensure that the dialog box displays the current settings 
associated with the task. For example, when a dialog box contains a control to show the current drive and directory, 
the procedure must determine the current drive and directory and set the control to that value.

The procedure can initialize controls by using functions such as SetDlgItemText and CheckDlgButton. Because controls are windows, 
the procedure can also manipulate them by using window-management functions such as EnableWindow and SetFocus.
The procedure can retrieve the window handle to a control by using the GetDlgItem function.

EnableWindow  --- Enables or disables mouse and keyboard input to the specified window or control. When input is disabled,
the window does not receive input such as mouse clicks and key presses. When input is enabled, the window receives all input.
BOOL EnableWindow(
  HWND hWnd,
  BOOL bEnable
);

SetFocus --- Sets the keyboard focus to the specified window.
HWND SetFocus(
  HWND hWnd
);

Retrieves a handle to a control in the specified dialog box. -- 
HWND GetDlgItem(
  HWND hDlg,
  int  nIDDlgItem
);
